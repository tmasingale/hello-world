**Travis Masingale Bio:**
Travis Masingale: 
complex phrase fan, doer, and reformed karaoke-ist. For the past ten years, he's wandered freely in the realm of higher education and reality design. A Bauhaus fanboy and child of postmodernism, existing on rearview sweet spots and remixed aesthetics. Spokane, WA #bornandraised. A design/art/tech-head producing at the intersection of craft and experience. All around professional doodler on a quest to develop visual systems that promote and inspire wonder.
